moodle_uploadcourse
===================

Bulk course uploader/creator for Moodle 2.2+.

This is based on one of the many 1.9 (and earlier) course upload scripts floating around tracker and elsewhere. Identified authors include Rory Alford, Ashley Gooding, Cole Spicer and Mark Johnson. This tool shares many similarities with Piers Harding's course uploader, both of which were developed from earlier products and based on the existing user uploader. See https://github.com/piersharding/moodle-tool_uploadcourse for Piers' excellent code.

This tool includes automatic category creation.
